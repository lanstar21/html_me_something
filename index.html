            <p> 
                Welcome to my Final Fantasy Brave Exvius page! 
                Here I will tell everyone about all the cool units 
                I have including many 7 star units. 
                Without further ado, here is a list of my units:
            </p>
            <h1> 7 star Hyoh </h1> 
            <img src= images/hyoh.jpg height="200" width="300" />
            <p>
                This is my most powerful unit sitting at 1700 atk. 
                He's level 115 right now, and I am working on a 
                fire weapon for him. All I need is a fire weapon, 
                and a second martial glove, and his build will be 
                complete.
            </p>
            <h2> 7 star Awakened Rain </h2>
            <img src= images/rain.jpeg height="200" width="300" />
            <p>
                This is my most powerful tank unit. With more than 10k
                hp, he's an absolute beast! He can guard the whole 
                team against magic attacks, has a unique sword, and 
                he has quite a few spirit boosting materia.
            </p>
            <h3> 6 star Tidus </h3>
            <img src= images/tidus.png height="200" width="300" />
            <p>
                My Tidus is fully decked out in tdh gear. He can reach 
                1400 atk. The only downside is his lack of chaining 
                partners. Still, he is a force to be reckoned with, 
                and one of my favorite units to play.
            </p>
            <h3>My journey so far</h3>
            <p>
                And there you have it, I am slowly but surely getting 
                better at this game, and my teams are looking stronger 
                than ever. I sure am a fan of this marvelous game, 
                Final Fantasy Brave Exvius.
            </p>
            <p>
                Until next time. KWEH!
